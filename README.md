# Welcome to Flat-tie Kreuger's Horror Emporium!
>This is a paired-programming project between @thequeenbeebs and @justinekimchi that is a one-stop-shop for horror fans to view and rate their favorite movies.

## Technologies
* Back end: Ruby on Rails
* Front end: React
* Routing: React Routes

## Set Up
### Back End 
* Clone down the back end of this application at https://github.com/justinekimchi/P4-backend
* In the terminal, run `bundle install` to installe gems.
* Set up the database by running `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`, and `rails db:seed`
* Start the server by running `rails s`. The server should be directed to localhost:3000.
### Front End
* Type `npm install` in the terminal and hit enter.
* Do the same with `npm start`. You will be prompted to run the app on another port because 3000 is full. Type `Y` for yes.

## Continuing Goals
* Build out shop functionality
* Refactor and clean up code
* Implement a styling framework over the vanilla CSS
